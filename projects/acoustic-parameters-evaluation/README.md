# Measurement and Evaluation of Acoustic Parameters

An analysis of the acoustic properties of a multipurpose auditorium using impulse response measurements and CATT-Acoustic simulations. I performed on-site measurements, processed the data in Audacity and Dirac 5.0, and calibrated a 3D acoustic model to evaluate parameters such as T20, C80, and STI, assessing the hall’s suitability for speech and music.
