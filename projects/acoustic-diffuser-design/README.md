# Acoustic Diffuser Design

A design and construction project of a 1D quadratic-residue acoustic diffuser developed in collaboration with **Jakub Wypchoł**. The work includes CAD modeling, assembly instructions, and material selection aimed at optimizing sound diffusion in small rooms. The diffuser geometry was designed to ensure balanced reflection and scattering of mid-to-high frequencies.
