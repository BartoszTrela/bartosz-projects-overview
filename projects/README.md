# Bartosz Trela — Project Portfolio

This folder contains a selection of my academic and engineering projects completed during my studies.  
They represent my practical experience in **acoustics**, **signal processing**, **machine learning**, and **embedded systems**.  

Each subfolder includes a brief description and related reports, designs, or code examples.

## Projects

### [Measurement and Evaluation of Acoustic Parameters](./measurement-and-evaluation-of-acoustic-parameters)
Acoustic analysis of a multipurpose auditorium using impulse response measurements and CATT-Acoustic simulations.  
I performed on-site measurements, processed the data in Audacity and Dirac 5.0, and calibrated a 3D acoustic model to evaluate parameters such as T20, C80, and STI.

---

### [Acoustic Diffuser Design](./acoustic-diffuser-design)
Design of a 1D quadratic-residue acoustic diffuser, including CAD modeling, material selection, and construction instructions.  
Developed to optimize sound diffusion in small rooms.

---

### [Guitar Tuner App](./guitar-tuner-matlab)
MATLAB App Designer project implementing a six-string guitar tuner.  
Performs real-time sound capture, filtering, and FFT analysis to detect tuning accuracy for each string.

---

### [Musical Instrument Classification Using Deep Learning](./instrument-classification-deep-learning)
Deep learning project using **transfer learning** with AlexNet to classify musical instruments (cello, flute, piano) based on spectrogram images.  
Built a custom dataset and achieved 91% accuracy using fine-tuned CNN and MATLAB’s Deep Learning Toolbox.

---

### [Voice Processing in a Stormtrooper Helmet](./stormtrooper-helmet-voice-processing)
Engineering thesis project — a wearable, real-time voice modulation system built into a 3D-printed helmet.  
Implements a custom DSP chain in **C++/JUCE** on **Raspberry Pi**, achieving realistic Stormtrooper voice reproduction.
